# NotOKCupid

[NotOKCupid Live](https://notokcupid.herokuapp.com)

NotOKCupid is a full-stack web application inspired by OKCupid, with a twist.  NotOKCupid's matching algorithm matches users based on their incompatibility, because sometimes the worst love matches turn out to be the best.  It utilizes Ruby on Rails on the backend, a PostgreSQL database, and React.js with a Redux architectural framework on the frontend.

## Future Directions for the Project

In addition to the features already implemented, I plan to continue work on this project. The next steps for NotOKCupid are outlined below.

### Search

I would like to implement user searching to give users access to other users that they aren't necessarily matched with.  

###  Block or hide other users

Users should be able to block/hide other users that they may not be interested in or have had a bad experience with.
